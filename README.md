# `bazel-mypy-integration`

_Integrate [MyPy](https://github.com/python/mypy) type-checking into your Python Bazel builds._

-----

[**`mypy`**](https://github.com/python/mypy) is an incremental type system for Python. Incremental type systems arguably become essential when Python codebases grow to be very large [[1](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/09/our-journey-to-type-checking-4-million-lines-of-python/), [2](https://www.facebook.com/notes/protect-the-graph/pyre-fast-type-checking-for-python/2048520695388071/), [3](https://instagram-engineering.com/let-your-code-type-hint-itself-introducing-open-source-monkeytype-a855c7284881), [4](https://github.com/google/pytype)]. As Bazel is a build system designed for very large codebases, it makes sense that they should work together to help a Python codebase scale.

With `bazel-mypy-integration`, type errors are flagged as `bazel build` errors, so that teams can be sure their type-checking is being respected.
